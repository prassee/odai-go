*(to be pronounced as "o" + "dai" )*

A simple and naive stream processing library written in Go. 

BTW "**odai**" is a Tamil word that means "**Stream**". 

This is a very early stage("pre-alpha") project, this has been created as a side 
of my Go "learning phase". I will try to keep this repo as active as possible.
